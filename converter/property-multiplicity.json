CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property.\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property.\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable.
